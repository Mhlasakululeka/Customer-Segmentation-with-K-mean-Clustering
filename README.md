# Customer Segmentation with K-mean Clustering

Problem: 
A client in the telecommunications industry has a pre-paid price plan that offers different calling rates depending on
the subscriber location and time of day when the call is made. The varying rate is achieved by applying a variable
discount to the base call rate of R2.50. Discounts are applied per cell tower, so all subscribers calling at the same
time on a cell receive the same discount for that time slot. The original intention of the price plan was to provide
cheaper rates where there was spare capacity on the cell, however there is potential to use the functionality for
more strategic marketing ventures with the aim of growing revenue, minutes of use and/or market share.
